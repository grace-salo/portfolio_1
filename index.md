<summary><b>Laboratory for Analytic Sciences (LAS) Projects</b></summary>
<br>
The Laboratory for Analytic Sciences is a research collaboration between the National Security Agency (NSA) and NC State University. As an intern, I worked with Pew Data .. ......, and researched trust in the NSA Analyst reporting space, including compiling a literature review, writing a blog post, and creating an accessible poster.  
<br></br>

After I wrote this blog post, it was posted to the "highside", a colloquial name for the restricted-access webpage for NSA Analysts to securely share information within the NSA intelligence community.
